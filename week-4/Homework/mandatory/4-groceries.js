/*
As you can have an Array of Objects, you can also store Arrays in Objects.
In this exercise, you'll practice:
 - How to loop through the properties (keys) of an Object and read its values.
 - How to access Arrays stored inside Object.
 - How to access to a specific item of an array via a property of an object and modify it.

You're going shopping, and you need a shopping list. You've already created your weekly meal plan
that contains the missing ingredients to your menus. It is stored in the "weeklyMealPlan" object.

Complete the exercises below.

Exercise 1:
  Loop through the weekly meal plan object to gather weakly ingredients into the weeklyGroceriesToBuy array.
  Then use console.log() to print out the list.

Exercise 2:
  Loop through your list again, but now only collect the weekend items into the weeklyGroceriesToBuy array.
  Then use console.log() to print out the list.

/*
Exercise 2:
  Loop through your weekly meal plan:
    - count how many ingredients you should buy each day
    - and update the corresponding properties of numberOfItemsPerWeak object.

  Finally use console.log() to print out the Object.
